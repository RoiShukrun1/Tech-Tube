- We held weekly meetings on Sundays and occasional daily stand-ups.
- Additionally, we added our personal touch to the project, such as designing the logo and naming the app.
- Whenever we encountered bugs or difficult features, we collaborated to find solutions together.
- Throughout the process, we learned a lot about both platforms and strengthened our coding skills.
- We are very pleased with the final result and hope you enjoy it as much as we do.
